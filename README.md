Kaggle Movie Dataset Analysis

# Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a Kaggle movie dataset through extensive data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning. The goal is to uncover insights and patterns in movie data, including aspects like ratings, votes, gross values, and runtime.

# Part 1: Data Cleaning
The initial phase of the project involves rigorous data cleaning to ensure the integrity and quality of the dataset. Key steps include:

- Removing duplicates.
- Formatting year, genre, and one-line columns.
- Handling missing values, particularly in the 'Gross' column.
- Splitting and cleaning 'Stars' into 'Directors' and 'Stars'.
- Exporting cleaned data for SQL analysis.
  
# Part 2: Exploratory Data Analysis
In this phase, we delve into the dataset through various visualizations:

Scatter plots to explore relationships between ratings, votes, and gross values.
Histograms and correlation heatmaps to understand distributions and correlations in the data.

# Technologies Used
Python: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, etc.
Jupyter Notebooks for analysis and visualization.
